## Intro

I Rashad Madison have completed this project for my Udacity Nanodegree.

## View

If you like to take a look at the project go to this url https://rashadmad.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/ .

## Instructions

This project is a continuation of a starter project through the Udacity program. I would suggest using the starter project that they provide, not mine.

Though if you would like to learn from how I attacked the project just fork this project to your repo.

## Contributing

I will most likely will not accept pull requests.
