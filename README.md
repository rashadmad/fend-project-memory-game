# Intro

I Rashad Madison have completed this project for my Udacity Nanodegree. I was bit of a challenge but I enjoyed it

## What I Learned

#### SetTimeout & SetInterval

I learned a great deal about the call stack with this project. Creating a timer really tests the limitations of the synchronous nature of the javaScript coding language.

SetTimeout & SetInterval really gave me difficulties during the project. I feel way more comfortable now after attacking that hurtle when it comes to making different

sets of code fire at different times. This also is a huge part of the simple animations that I added to the project. I know that SetTimeout & SetInterval will be a huge

part of creating the cool animations that I plan on making in my career.

#### const & let

I fully understand the new ES6 usage of `const` and `let`. I have prior experience with constants from my time coding in Java and I always wondered why JavaScript

didn't have constants. You use constants for variables that don't need to change while using let for variables that do in fact change.

#### manipulateing the DOM

`classList` are your friend. They allow you to get, make changes to and add classes to element on the DOM. This project demanded create elements either through concatination of strings i.e.: `overlayStr = '<div id="congrats"><h1>Congratulations You win.</h1>' + '<h1>' + 'Here is your score.</h1>' + '<p class = "blue">It took you ' + minHolder.textContent + 'utes' + ' and ' + secHolder.textContent + 'ounds' + '</p>' + '<p class = "blue">to complete, your star rating is ' + starRating + '</p>' + '<p class = "blue"> it took you ' + movesCounter + ' moves to finsh</p>' + '<h1>Thank you for playing</h1>' + '<h1>Would you like to play agin?</h1><br><i class="blue far fa-thumbs-up"></i><br><button style="cursor: pointer;" onclick = playAgin()>Play Again</button></div>';
    document.body.appendChild(overlay);`


## What I enjoyed

The dynamic of using CSS classes coupled with JavaScript's ability to manipulate the DOM was quite fun I really feel that I can hack a web page now and make it

do just about anything I want it to.

## View

If you like to take a look at the project go to this url https://rashadmad.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/ .

## Instructions

This project is a continuation of a starter project through the Udacity program. I would suggest using the starter project that they provide, not mine.

Though if you would like to learn from how I attacked the project just fork this project to your repo.

## Contributing

I will most likely will not accept pull requests.
